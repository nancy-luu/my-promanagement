## Process

As project management applications are ubiquitous in various industries and sectors, I wanted to delve deeper into the core functionalities that contribute to their success. 

I chose Firebase for its serverless architecture and real-time data synchronization, which streamline development, minimize server management, and support rapid, scalable application development with a focus on user experience and performance.

### Technologies:
React JS | Firebase | Firestore | NoSQL | HTML | CSS | D3.js

### Data Management:
To facilitate testing and usage of the site without manual database management, I used Firebase Cloud Functions to automatically purge the database. This process ensures that all documents are cleared every 24 hours, providing a fresh environment for users to test all functionalities. And eliminates the need for manual document deletion on my part! woo - more time to code other things (˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶)
